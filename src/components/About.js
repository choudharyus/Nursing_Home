My plan to design the site that provide the families quick access to the basic information about the nursing home such as; Number of beds (capacity) of the nursning home, Quality star rating of the nursing home, Number of nursing home available in the area, Total number of penalities, violations or fines of the nursing home.

A special thanks to the personnel inlcuding GA instructor Ali Spittel, Carlos Godoy, Kenneth Cruz, Nathaniel Stack and Joe Keohan (Squad Supervisior - Project2).</p>
